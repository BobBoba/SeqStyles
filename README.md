# Style for Seq

After a while I noticed that I need tighter style for my Seq instance as I have many columns to show.

![example](https://github.com/BobBoba/SeqStyles/blob/master/2019-10-03%2015%2010%2008.png)

to try, copy-paste content of any `.css` file into : `Seq` -> `Settings` -> `Instance` -> `Style overrides` field
